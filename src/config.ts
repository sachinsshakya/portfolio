  aboutMe:
    "I’m a detail-oriented Full Stack Software Engineer with 6.5 years of experience building scalable, high-performance web applications. I specialize in crafting reliable and maintainable solutions using React, Next.js, Node.js (Express), and Java (Spring Boot), with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, performance optimization, and collaborative development. Beyond traditional full-stack work, I have hands-on experience in Generative AI, Agentic AI, and MCP server implementations, allowing me to design intelligent, adaptive systems that go beyond static workflows. I’m equally comfortable working independently or as part of a fast-moving team, and I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. I believe great software is built at the intersection of solid engineering, thoughtful design, and continuous learning—and that’s the mindset I bring to every project.",
